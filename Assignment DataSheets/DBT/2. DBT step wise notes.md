# ✅ 1. What is dbt? (Data Build Tool)

**dbt = SQL + Version Control + Testing + Documentation + Deployment**

dbt is a framework used by Data Engineers & Analytics Engineers to **transform data inside the data warehouse or lakehouse**.

dbt does NOT extract or load data.
It only does the **T (Transform) in ELT**.

## ✅ 2. Why dbt is helpful now?

Modern data platforms (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Redshift) follow **ELT**, not ETL.

### ✔ Old way (ETL):

Transform inside tools like Informatica, SSIS, Talend

Data warehouse used only for storage

### ✔ New way (ELT):

Load raw data to lakehouse (Delta Lake)

Transform using SQL inside the warehouse

dbt manages all transformations

### dbt is helpful because it provides:

- ✓ Modular SQL development

- ✓ Version control in Git

- ✓ Testing (data quality, constraints)

- ✓ Documentation (auto-generated lineage)

- ✓ Orchestration (schedules)

- ✓ CI/CD for data pipelines

- ✓ Data lineage graphs

### ✅ 3. Before dbt vs After dbt — Real Scenarios
#### 🔴 Before dbt (Old Way)
##### ❌ Scenario 1: Manual SQL Scripts

- Hundreds of SQL scripts stored in shared folder

- No one knows dependencies

- If one table fails → everything breaks

- Hard to debug / no version control

### ❌ Scenario 2: ETL tools doing transformation

- SSIS/Informatica jobs were heavy

- Transformations happened outside data warehouse

- Expensive computing

- Data lineage unclear

#### ❌ Scenario 3: No data quality testing

- Data issues only discovered by business users

- No automated tests

- No data contracts

#### 🟢 After dbt (Modern Way)
- ✔ Scenario 1: Modular SQL
- SQL models stored as .sql files
- dbt manages dependencies automatically

Runs only changed models

### ✔ Scenario 2: Git + CI/CD

- Every change tracked
- PR approval
- Automated testing before merging

### ✔ Scenario 3: Auto Lineage + Docs
- dbt automatically builds
- **lineage graph** → raw → staging → gold
- Anyone can see where data came from

## ✅ 4. How dbt Works (Architecture)
![alt text](image-10.png)

#### dbt workflow:
- **Sources** (raw data in Bronze layer)
- **Staging Models** (clean, standardized)
- **Intermediate Models** (joins, enrichment)
- **Gold Models** (business tables, marts)
- **Tests** (unique, not null, relationships)
- **Docs** (auto-generated)
- **Runs** (orchestrated jobs)
