## 1. What is Amazon SageMaker?

**Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed ML platform** on AWS for building, training, and deploying ML and GenAI models at scale. It provides managed Jupyter environments, training jobs, hyper-parameter tuning, model registry, endpoints, pipelines (MLOps), and a feature store.

Since Dec 2024, AWS talks about “next-generation SageMaker” as a **unified platform for data, analytics, and AI,** but for your use case you can think of it as:

**“Databricks is the lakehouse for data; SageMaker is the managed platform for ML/AI experiments, training, and deployment on AWS.”**

## Key capabilities:

Managed **training jobs** on CPU/GPU instances

**Built-in algorithms** (XGBoost, image, text, time-series, etc.)

**Endpoints** for real-time or batch inference

**SageMaker Pipelines** for end-to-end MLOps

**Feature Store, Model Registry, Data Wrangler, Clarify, Studio,** etc
